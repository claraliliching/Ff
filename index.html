        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <div class="method">
            <strong>Diet Changes:</strong>
            <p>I focused on a balanced diet that includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased Fruits and Vegetables:</strong> I aim for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables each day. This helps me feel full while consuming fewer calories.</li>
                <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> I switched to whole grains, such as brown rice and whole grain bread, which provide more fiber and nutrients.</li>
                <li><strong>Lean Proteins:</strong> I incorporate lean proteins like chicken, fish, beans, and legumes to support muscle maintenance while losing weight.</li>
                <li><strong>Portion Control:</strong> I measure my portions to avoid overeating, using smaller plates and bowls to help control serving sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>Limiting Processed Foods:</strong> I try to avoid processed snacks and sugary drinks, opting instead for water, herbal teas, or homemade snacks.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="method">
            <strong>Exercise Plan:</strong>
            <p>My exercise routine includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cardio Workouts:</strong> I engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.</li>
                <li><strong>Strength Training:</strong> I do strength training exercises at least twice a week, focusing on all major muscle groups to build lean muscle mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexibility and Balance:</strong> I incorporate activities like yoga or stretching to improve flexibility and help prevent injuries.</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Movement:</strong> I make an effort to stay active throughout the day, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking during breaks.</li>
            </ul>
